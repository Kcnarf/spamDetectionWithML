# spamDetectionWithML
Exploring spam detection through Machine Learning

[SpamDetection.ipynb](https://github.com/Kcnarf/spamDetectionWithML/blob/master/SpamDetection.ipynb) experimentation based on [Using Natural Language Processing for Spam Detection in Emails](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/using-natural-language-processing-for-spam-detection-in-emails-281a7c22ddbc) (⚠️ [new location](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection) of data)

[spamDetection_withGloveEmbeddings.ipynb](https://github.com/Kcnarf/spamDetectionWithML/blob/master/spamDetection_withGloveEmbeddings.ipynb) experimentation based on [Using pre-trained word embeddings](https://keras.io/examples/nlp/pretrained_word_embeddings/#load-pretrained-word-embeddings); reuse GloVe embeddings (instead of the trainable keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer of the previous experimentation)
